You can play it in your browser window, or stand-alone.  I created this to learn a bit about OpenGL and to experiment with writing a game using a scripting language (Python), and experiment with Jython for creating Java programs.\r\n\r\n[Play it in your browser.](http://downloads.borsboom.io/babal/babal_applet.html)\r\n\r\nSee [README.txt](https://github.com/borsboom/babal/blob/master/README.txt) for instructions and copyright.  \r\nSee [COPYING.txt](https://github.com/borsboom/babal/blob/master/COPYING.txt) for the license.  \r\nSee [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/borsboom/babal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) for the log of changes.  \r\nGet the source code on [Github](https://github.com/borsboom/babal)  \r\nDownload the Windows executable: [babal-win32.zip](http://downloads.borsboom.io/babal/babal-win32.zip)\r\n\r\nIf the game applet does not appear above, or it runs very slowly, or there are graphics glitches, try any one of these options:\r\n\r\n* If you're running Windows, download, unzip, and run the Windows executable.\r\n* Download and install the [Java Plug-in](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html) from Sun.\r\n* Other platforms can download the source code and run it using Python.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
