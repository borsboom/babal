- Re-organised JGLBabalCanvas to better handle resizing
- Pause
- Properly handle time when game not running (e.g. minimized window or applet
  stopped)
- Fixed: If leftmost column is filled, you can move past the left the space of
  one column
- On startup, choose correct initial position rather than defaulting to centre
  (and immediately crashing if the centre is not filled)
- If crash lands on empty row, move forward until non-empty row is found.
- Ball rotation wraps around so it is always in [0,360).
- Basic joystick support in the pyopengl version.  No analog controls.
- When calling v_zero_cb in MotionPhysics, calculate time at which velocity was
  actually zero and call it with MotionPhysics in the state it would have been
  at that time.  This prevents the ball shooting off in the opposite direction
  when you decelerate it and the game is running at a low framerate.
